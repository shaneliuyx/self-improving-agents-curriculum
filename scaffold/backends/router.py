"""
backends/router.py - Route a task step to the appropriate backend/model.

RATIONALE (from the Reddit r/AI_Agents community reality check):
  "Don't default to the flagship model for every call; cheaper/older models
   often match at far lower cost."

For LOCAL backends this maps to:
  - CHEAP steps (simple arithmetic, formatting, short lookups):
    -> oMLX small model (fast, zero latency, no rate-limit pressure)
  - HARD steps (multi-step reasoning, reflection, code generation, eval):
    -> oMLX large model OR VibeProxy/Claude (richer reasoning)

Because these backends are RATE-LIMITED rather than per-token-metered, the
cost of routing everything to the large model is throughput exhaustion, not
money. Routing cheap steps locally preserves rate-limit headroom for hard
steps.

Difficulty levels:
  "trivial"  - single lookup, format conversion, yes/no question
  "easy"     - short calculation, simple tool call
  "medium"   - multi-step reasoning, code snippet
  "hard"     - reflection, self-critique, system-prompt mutation
  "critical" - eval gate, accepting/rejecting a self-modification
